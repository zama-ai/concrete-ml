# For the following tests, we need to make sure all circuits don't reach more than 16 bits of
# precision as some have a PBS.
# Besides, the associated PBS model (TorchSum with 'with_pbs' set to True) needs an extra bit
# when executed, meaning that the maximum n_bits value possible to consider is 15, even if a single
# value is summed.
# Additionally, in Concrete ML, we consider that all inputs' first dimension should be a batch size
# even in single batch cases. This is why the following test parameters are considering axes that
# are sometimes equal to the input size's dimension, as the batch size is added within the
# test itself.
# Finally, the axis parameter should neither be None nor contain axis 0 as this dimension is used
# for batching the inference
