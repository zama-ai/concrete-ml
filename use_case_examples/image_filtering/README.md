# Image filtering using FHE

We have created a [Hugging Face space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/zama-fhe/encrypted_image_filtering) to apply filters over images homomorphically using the developer-friendly tools in [Concrete](https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete) and [Concrete ML](https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete-ml). This means the data is encrypted both in transit and during processing.

A [tutorial](https://www.zama.ai/post/encrypted-image-filtering-using-homomorphic-encryption) has also been published alongside. It describes the few steps needed for replicating such a demo and be able to experiment with new customizable filters. All development files are available [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/zama-fhe/encrypted_image_filtering/tree/main).
