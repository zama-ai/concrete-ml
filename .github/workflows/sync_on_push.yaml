      # Initial action can be found here: https://github.com/wei/git-sync
      # The issue is that it does not handle new LFS files when pushing, only the ones that are 
      # already existing ones. We therefore had to fork it and add the feature manually. In 
      # particular, trying to rewrite the action directly here as a step does not work because of
      # some authorization issues and thus requires to further investigate on the right 
      # configuration to use. This is not needed with external actions like this one as they
      # are specifically allowed in the repository's settings
