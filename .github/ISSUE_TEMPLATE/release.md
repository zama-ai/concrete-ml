- [ ] Version management
- [ ] Preparing the right commit: prepare the commit you want to release, either directly on main or in a `release/X.Y.x` branch
- [ ] Main part of the release: releasing in the repository
- [ ] Management of `release/X.Y.x` branch (if needed)
- [ ] Check links in docs with `make check_links`
- [ ] If needed: prepare an official release
