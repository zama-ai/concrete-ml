    Non-native types are serialized manually and dumped in a custom dict format that stores both the

    The name should be unique for each type, as it is used in the ConcreteDecoder class to detect
    the initial type and apply the proper load method to the serialized object. The serialized
    value is the value that was serialized manually in a native type. Additional arguments such
    as a numpy array's dtype are also properly serialized. If an object has an unexpected type or
    is not serializable, an error is thrown.

    The ConcreteEncoder is only meant to encode Concrete-ML's built-in models and therefore only
    supports the necessary types. For example, torch.Tensor objects are not serializable using this
    encoder as built-in models only use numpy arrays. However, the list of supported types might
    expand in future releases if new models are added and need new types.

        Natively, among other types, the JSONENcoder handles integers, floating points and tuples.
        However, a numpy.integer (resp. numpy.floating) object is automatically casted to a built-in
        int (resp. float) object, without keeping their dtype information. Similarly, a tuple is
        casted to a list, meaning that it will then be loaded as a list, which notably does not have
        the uniqueness property and therefore might cause issues in complex structures such as
        QuantizedModule instances. This is an issue as JSONEncoder only calls its customizable
        `default` method at the end of the parsing. We thus need to provide this custom isinstance
        method in order to make the encoder avoid handling these specific types until `default` is
        reached (where they are properly serialized using our custom format).
