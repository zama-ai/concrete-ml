"""p_error binary search for classification and regression tasks.

Only PyTorch neural networks and Concrete built-in models are supported.
- Concrete built-in models include trees and QNN
- Quantized aware trained model are supported using Brevitas framework
- Torch models can be converted into post-trained quantized models

The `p_error` represents an essential hyper-parameter in the FHE computation at Zama.
As it impacts the speed of the FHE computations and the model's performance.

In this script, we provide an approach to find out an optimal `p_error`, which would offer
an interesting compromise between speed and efficiency.

The `p_error` represents the probability of a single PBS being incorrect. Know that the FHE
scheme allows to perform 2 types of operations
- Linear operations: additions and multiplications
- Non-linear operation: uni-variate activation functions

At Zama, non-linear operations are represented by table lookup (TLU), which are implemented
through the Programmable Bootstrapping technology (PBS).
A single PBS operation has `p_error` chances of being incorrect.

It's highly recommended to adjust the `p_error` as it is linked to the data-set.

The inference is performed via the FHE simulation mode.

The goal is to look for the largest `p_error_i`, a float ∈ ]0,0.9[, which gives a model_i that has
`accuracy_i`, such that: | accuracy_i - accuracy_0| <= Threshold, where: Threshold ∈ R, given
by the user and `accuracy_0` refers to original model_0 with `p_error_0 ≈ 0.0`.

`p_error` is bounded between 0 and 0.9
`p_error ≈ 0.0`, refers to the original model in clear, that gives an accuracy that we note
as `accuracy_0`.

We assume that the condition is satisfied when we have a match
A match is defined as a uni-variate function, through `strategy` argument, given by the user, it
can be

`any = lambda all_matches: any(all_matches)`
`all = lambda all_matches: all(all_matches)`
`mean = lambda all_matches: numpy.mean(all_matches) >= 0.5`
`median = lambda all_matches: numpy.median(all_matches) == 1`

To validate the results of the FHE simulation and get a stable estimation, we do several simulations
If match, we update the lower bound to be the current `p_error`
Else, we update the upper bound to be the current `p_error`
Update the current `p_error` with the mean of the bounds

We stop the search when the maximum number of iterations is reached.

If we don't reach the convergence, a user warning is raised.
